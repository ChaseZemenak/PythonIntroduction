# PythonIntroduction
This is simply a very basic project that shows basic understanding of the use of functions in Python

1. Created 3 variables... one string, one number and one boolean value to show the use of each primary data type
2. These variable contents included my name, age, and whether or not I was a hard working software developer

3. Created functions for each of these variables, and called a printout for each of these 3 variables
4. For the boolean function, I created a conditional if statement for the value of the boolean variable being true. I then made a condition for if the value of the
boolean variable is not true using the elif keyword

5. Finally, I called all 3 of the functions that I created in order to print out the results of the basic program using basic functions
